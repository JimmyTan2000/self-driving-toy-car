# jetson-self-driving-toy-car

## Description
The goal of this project is to create a simple self-driving toy car using [Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network) build in PyTorch.
Its capabilities include path following and collision avoidance.

# Additional Information
We named our robot "Heribert-bert". This name might appear multiple times in our documentation. I think it is better to clarify this here to avoid any confusion.
